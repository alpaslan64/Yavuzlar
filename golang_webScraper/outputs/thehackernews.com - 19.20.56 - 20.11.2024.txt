Title: Ghost Tap: Hackers Exploiting NFCGate to Steal Funds via Mobile Payments
Date: Nov 20, 2024
Description: Threat actors are increasingly banking on a new technique that leverages near-field communication (NFC) to cash out victim's funds at scale.  The technique, codenamed Ghost Tap  by ThreatFabric, enables  cybercriminals to cash-out money from stolen credit cards linked to mobile payment services such as Google Pay or Apple Pay and relaying NFC traffic.  "Criminals can now misuse Google Pay and Apple Pay to transmit your tap-to-pay information globally within seconds," the Dutch security company told The Hacker News in a statement. "This means that even without your physical card or phone, they can make payments from your account anywhere in the world."  These attacks typically work by tricking victims into downloading mobile banking malware that can capture their banking credentials and one-time passwords using an overlay attack or a keylogger. Alternatively, it can involve a voice phishing component.   Once in possession of the card details, the threat actors m

Title: NHIs Are the Future of Cybersecurity: Meet NHIDR
Date: Nov 20, 2024
Description: The frequency and sophistication of modern cyberattacks are surging, making it increasingly challenging for organizations to protect sensitive data and critical infrastructure. When attackers compromise a non-human identity (NHI), they can swiftly exploit it to move laterally across systems, identifying vulnerabilities and compromising additional NHIs in minutes. While organizations often take months to detect and contain such breaches, rapid detection and response can stop an attack in its tracks.  The Rise of Non-Human Identities in Cybersecurity  By 2025, non-human identities  will rise to be the primary attack vector in cybersecurity. As businesses increasingly automate processes and adopt AI and IoT technologies, the number of NHIs grows exponentially. While these systems drive efficiency, they also create an expanded attack surface for cybercriminals.  NHIs differ fundamentally from human users, making traditional security tools like multi-factor authentication and user behavior

Title: Decades-Old Security Vulnerabilities Found in Ubuntu's Needrestart Package
Date: Nov 20, 2024
Description: Multiple decade-old security vulnerabilities have been disclosed in the needrestart package installed by default in Ubuntu Server (since version 21.04) that could allow a local attacker to gain root privileges without requiring user interaction.  The Qualys Threat Research Unit (TRU), which identified and reported  the flaws early last month, said they are trivial to exploit, necessitating that users move quickly to apply the fixes. The vulnerabilities are believed to have existed since the introduction of interpreter support in needrestart 0.8 , which was released on April 27, 2014.  "These needrestart exploits allow Local Privilege Escalation (LPE) which means that a local attacker is able to gain root privileges," Ubuntu said  in an advisory, noting they have been addressed in version 3.8. "The vulnerabilities affect Debian, Ubuntu, and other Linux distributions."  Needrestart is a utility that scans a system to determine the services that need to be restarted a

Title: Microsoft Launches Windows Resiliency Initiative to Boost Security and System Integrity
Date: Nov 20, 2024
Description: Microsoft has announced a new Windows Resiliency Initiative  as a way to improve security and reliability, as well as ensure that system integrity is not compromised.  The idea, the tech giant said, is to avoid incidents  like that of CrowdStrike's earlier this July, enable more apps and users to be run without admin privileges, add controls surrounding the use of unsafe apps and drivers, and offer options to encrypt personal data.  One of the most important features is Quick Machine Recovery  that's expected to be available to the Windows Insider Program community in early 2025.  "This feature will enable IT administrators to execute targeted fixes from Windows Update on PCs, even when machines are unable to boot, without needing physical access to the PC," David Weston, vice president of enterprise and OS security at Microsoft, said . "This remote recovery will unblock your employees from broad issues much faster than what has been possible in the past."
